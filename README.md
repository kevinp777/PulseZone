# dronezone.space
~Pulse Zone~ dronezone.space is my final project from General Assemblyâ€™s Front End Web Development course that I completed in December 2019. 

It is a musical instrument inspired by grid-based MIDI controllers. It features nine pads that when clicked, play short loops of original music and pulse different colors. All sounds are original samples from my own hardware modular synths.
