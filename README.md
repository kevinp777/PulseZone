# PulseZone
Pulse Zone is my final project from General Assemblyâ€™s Front End Web Development course that I completed in December 2019. 

It is a musical instrument inspired by the Monome and other grid-based audio controllers. It features nine pads that when clicked, play short loops of original music and pulse different colors. All sounds were created by me using a guitar and various software synths on a Mac.
